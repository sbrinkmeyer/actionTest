  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

      - main
      - uat

# set a default for the TISSUE environment variable.  this should come from the 
# main/default settings

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # set the environment based on branch
    environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/uat' && 'uat' || 'default' }}

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      #  like this the runner
      - name: Run a one-line script
